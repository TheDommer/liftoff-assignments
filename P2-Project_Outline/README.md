## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be for a customizable, online training system.  There will be three basic levels: 
-Admin: This level will allow the user to create training material, including outlines of guidelines and policies, links to websites for training, and attachments for documents, such as proof of outside training.  Information can be divided into categories and the subdivided into topics for each category.  The admin can set due dates and require timestamps on when training is completed.  Finally, the admin can assign trainings by category for each staff so that training can be customized for different positions.  
-Trainer: This level will manage training assignments for trainee staff.  The individual with this level of access will be responsible for reviewing all information with trainee and confirming that training was completed.  Trainer will also have the ability to add any notes to topics discussed. Once a topic is completed, it will be passed to the next trainee level to show that this was completed.  
-Trainee: This level will have show all training material assigned to the trainee, what is completed, and what is pending.  The trainee will also have to confirm they have completed the training and have had the opporunity to ask questions.  

### Features
Topic Database: Admin level users can create an ongoing database of training topics which can be added to, editied, and deleted as necessary. 
User Login: Each user level will have secure login features.  
Due date/timestamp: Each topic will be able to have a due date assigned and allow for a timestamp of when the training is completed.  
Completed Training Record: All levels will have a database showing what training has been completed for each trainee profile.  

### Technologies
Projected technologies that will be used include:
C# 
ASP.NET/MVP 
MySQL or other database management 

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll mostly be using technologies I'm at least familiar with.  I anticipate that learning to use different levels of access will require me to learn new skills with how manage this.  I may explore other database options than I have used previously.
